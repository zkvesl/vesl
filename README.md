# Vesl

A verification SDK for Nockchain. Four primitives — **mint** (commit), **guard** (verify), **settle** (on-chain), **forge** (STARK-prove) — each shipping as a Hoon kernel with a Rust facade in `vesl-core`, graft templates for adding them to an existing NockApp, and `hull-rag` as a reference implementation.


## Demo

```bash
# Reference pipeline (hull-rag) — no chain required, runs in ~30 seconds
./scripts/demo.sh --no-chain

# Full pipeline with live fakenet settlement
./scripts/demo.sh
```

Ingest documents, retrieve against a query, verify in the kernel, settle. `--no-chain` skips chain interaction.

## Nockchain for Rust Developers

If you're coming from EVM or Solidity, this table will save you a few hours of head-scratching.

| Nockchain | EVM equivalent |
|-----------|---------------|
| kernel | smart contract |
| hull | dApp backend / off-chain server |
| poke | transaction / state-changing call |
| peek | view / staticcall (read-only) |
| hoonc | solc (compiler) |
| NockApp | dApp |
| the subject | contract storage |
| crash | revert |
| nockvm | EVM (deterministic interpreter, but in-process — not a separate VM) |

A **kernel** is a Hoon program compiled to Nock that runs inside a NockApp. It holds state in *the subject* (think: a single persistent storage slot that's the entire state tree) and responds to pokes and peeks. Pokes mutate state and return effects; peeks read without changing anything. If something goes wrong, the kernel crashes — equivalent to a Solidity `revert`, the state change gets discarded.

The **hull** is the off-chain Rust process that hosts the kernel, handles HTTP, talks to the chain, and does the heavy lifting (Merkle trees, LLM calls, transaction construction). Kernels don't do I/O — the hull does.

**hoonc** compiles Hoon source to a `.jam` binary. No ABI, no deploy step — the compiled noun *is* the program.

If you know Foundry, think of `make demo-local` as `forge test` — it runs the full pipeline locally without touching a chain.


## Quick Start

Two ways in, depending on what you're building.

### Docker — full environment, zero setup

Use Docker if you want to run the Vesl pipeline (ingest, query, settle) or hack on the Vesl codebase itself. The container ships hoonc, nockchain, hull-rag, and all compiled kernels. Nothing to install on the host.

Pull the prebuilt image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zkvesl/vesl):

```bash
docker pull zkvesl/vesl:latest
docker run -it zkvesl/vesl:latest
make demo-local
```

Or build it locally from the `Dockerfile` in this repo: `docker build -t zkvesl/vesl:latest - < Dockerfile`.

### NockUp — add verification to your NockApp

If you're building a NockApp with `nockup` and want to graft Vesl's verification primitives onto it, head to [vesl-nockup](https://github.com/zkVesl/vesl-nockup). That repo has pre-resolved git deps, a `graft-inject` CLI that auto-wires your kernel, a `vesl-test` harness, and a full walkthrough — none of which you need to clone this monorepo for.

For developers integrating by hand or from Docker, [GRAFTING.md](templates/GRAFTING.md) is the long-form guide.

### Manual Setup

For contributors who want a local nockchain checkout and bare-metal builds.

Prerequisites: [nockchain](https://github.com/zorp-corp/nockchain) monorepo cloned and built at a sibling path, with `hoonc` and `nockchain` in your PATH. Rust nightly `2025-11-26` (pinned in `hull/rust-toolchain`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zkVesl/vesl.git
cd vesl
cp vesl.toml.example vesl.toml     # edit nock_home if your layout differs
make setup                          # create hoon symlinks
make build                          # compile hull
make demo-local                     # run the pipeline (no chain needed)
```

Run `make help` for all available targets. Configuration lives in `vesl.toml` — see `vesl.toml.example` for options. Environment variables (`NOCK_HOME`, `OLLAMA_URL`, `API_PORT`) override config file values.

After running the demo, `make inspect` shows what settled — current root, note count, recent note summaries. Requires a running hull (`--serve` mode).


## Test

```bash
make test-unit                      # 99 unit tests
make test                           # all tests (unit + e2e)
```

Fakenet (live local chain):

```bash
./scripts/fakenet-harness.sh run    # boot nodes, run 20 integration tests, tear down
```

Hoon tests are compile-time assertions — build success means pass:

```bash
hoonc --new protocol/tests/red-team.hoon hoon/
hoonc --new protocol/tests/prove-verify.hoon hoon/
```


## Settlement Modes

Vesl supports three settlement modes. Set via `--settlement-mode`, `VESL_SETTLEMENT_MODE`, or `settlement_mode` in `vesl.toml`.

| Mode | What happens | Chain required |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `local` | Kernel verifies, no chain interaction. Default. | No |
| `fakenet` | Full pipeline — sign, build tx, submit to a local nockchain fakenet. | Yes (local) |
| `dumbnet` | Same as fakenet but uses a real seed phrase for key derivation. | Yes (live) |

Precedence: CLI flag > environment variable > `vesl.toml` > mode defaults. Passing `--chain-endpoint` or `--submit` without an explicit mode infers `fakenet`.


## Fakenet Settlement Walkthrough

Run the full pipeline: ingest documents, retrieve against a query, verify in the Hoon kernel, build a settlement transaction, sign it, and submit to a local chain.

```bash
# 1. Build everything
make setup                              # hoon symlinks
make build                              # compile hull (release)

# 2. Boot a local fakenet (hub + miner, background)
./scripts/fakenet-harness.sh start

# 3. Run the demo with live settlement
./scripts/demo.sh --fakenet

# 4. Or drive it manually via the HTTP API
cd hull && cargo run -- --new --serve --settlement-mode fakenet

# In another terminal:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/ingest \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"documents": ["Q3 revenue: $47M, up 12% YoY"]}'

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": "Summarize Q3 financial position", "top_k": 2}'

# /query triggers: retrieve → LLM → manifest → kernel verify → sign → settle
# The response includes the settlement result and transaction ID.

# 5. Run the full E2E test suite against the running fakenet
./scripts/fakenet-harness.sh test

# 6. Tear down
./scripts/fakenet-harness.sh stop
```

Or do it all in one shot:

```bash
./scripts/fakenet-harness.sh run        # boot → test → teardown
```

The harness mines to a demo signing key so the hull can spend coinbase UTXOs without wallet setup.


## Standalone Crates

These work independently of Vesl. Any NockApp can use them. Built on primitives from the [nockchain](https://github.com/zorp-corp/nockchain) monorepo — packaged as standalone libraries with documentation.

**[nock-noun-rs](crates/nock-noun-rs/)** — Build Nock nouns from Rust without reading 57K lines of wallet code. NockStack helpers, cord/tag/loobean builders, jam/cue round-trips. Handles the footguns (loobeans are inverted, cords aren't strings, lists are null-terminated) so you don't have to.

**[nockchain-tip5-rs](crates/nockchain-tip5-rs/)** — Standalone tip5 Merkle tree. ~100 arithmetic constraints per hash vs ~30,000 for SHA-256 — 100x cheaper in ZK circuits. Cross-runtime aligned: Rust output is byte-identical to Hoon.

**[vesl-test](protocol/lib/vesl-test.hoon)** — Compile-time Hoon testing. Eight assertion arms, zero configuration, no test runner. If it builds, it passes.


## Compile the Kernel

```bash
hoonc --new protocol/lib/vesl-kernel.hoon hoon/
cp out.jam assets/vesl.jam
```

Use `--new` after modifying Hoon source. hoonc caches aggressively.


## HTTP API

```bash
cd hull && cargo run -- --new --serve
```

| Endpoint | Method | |
|----------|--------|-|
| `/ingest` | POST | documents in, Merkle tree out |
| `/query` | POST | natural language query, triggers retrieval + settlement |
| `/prove` | POST | like `/query` but adds STARK proof (needs `--stack-size large`) |
| `/status` | GET | tree state, settled notes, root |
| `/health` | GET | liveness |

Use `--new` on first boot (or after kernel recompilation) to avoid stale NockApp state. For STARK proving, boot with `--stack-size huge` (see hardware requirements below). For real LLM inference, pass `--ollama-url http://localhost:11434`. Works with remote Ollama instances too, e.g. RunPod: `--ollama-url https://{pod-id}-11434.proxy.runpod.net`.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To expose to the network, pass `--bind-addr 0.0.0.0`. For dumbnet mode, pass the signing key via `--seed-phrase-file <path>` (reads one line, trimmed) instead of `--seed-phrase` to keep the value out of `ps` output.


## Hardware Requirements

`/query` and `/settle` run on modest hardware (4 GB RAM, `--stack-size normal`).

`/prove` generates a STARK proof and needs significantly more. The Nockchain STARK prover allocates a 64 GB NockStack and is CPU-bound during FRI commitment and constraint evaluation.

| | Verify only | STARK proof |
|-|-------------|-------------|
| RAM | 4 GB | 64+ GB |
| Stack flag | `--stack-size normal` | `--stack-size huge` |

On Linux, enable overcommit for the large virtual allocation:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory=1
```
